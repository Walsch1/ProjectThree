  <p>You enjoy a nice night rest. You and Brian realize you can get much farther
  traveling the backroads as it is much safer and less supplies taken along the way. You guys travel safely
  making safe decisions and taking turns sleeping at night.</p>
  <p>You both travel on for a few days almost making it all the way to Cali. You are currently in Medford Oregon.
  You both estimate another day until you reach California. </p>
  <p>You both have killed many zombies over the past week. You realize you would
  have had to kill many more if you took the highways, maybe not even survive that.
  You continue on.</p>
