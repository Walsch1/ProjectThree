  <p>Youve decided to go even farther into Cali and ended up in Hollywood.
  In the week or so that has passed you and Brian decided to have some fun. You ventured into
  some famous peoples houses and played some basketball in their back yards. But you know it wouldnt
  be smart to stay there long. Also trying to be weary of people who are house squating.</p>
  <p>You decided you had enough fun for now, at least as much fun as You
  can think you can have. Its good to stay alert as zombies are always around.
  Brian asks you what you think is the next step. Find a car and take the long way to the boating dock
  or cut through the city?</p>
