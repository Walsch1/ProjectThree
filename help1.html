  <p>You throw a rock at the car on the far side of the building. The car alarm
  goes off distracting the zombies away from the man. You run out and grab the man from
  the zombies coving his mouth so he stops screaming. You both take off into the woods.</p>

  <p>You manage to sit down and learn about your new friend. His name is Brian. He was
  a high school math teacher before all this happened. You both share what you have in your bags which isnt much.
  You tell him your idea about going to Australia because you heard on the news during the beginning that they were immediately building
  borders and containing the desease. He quickly shuts down the idea because he says its too far and explains
  that he heard on the radio about a safe haven a week prior and happened to find a map nailed to a tree in the woods which
  seemed to be accurate to the radio call. You decide to go on the trip together to this safe haven due to it being recent info.</p>
