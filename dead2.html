<div class="start">
  <p>You get to the high way. It seems good to start. You realize with so many cars
   that there are zombies that are bound to be around. You find food and water in some of the empty cars.
    Brian wants to continue farther but you didnt think it was a good idea. You realize the woods are swarmed with zombies.
    you tell Brian, and he accidently sets a car alarm off. Zombies come from all sides and you are
    on a run for your life. But you couldnt run forever. The zombies got to both you and Brian.</p>
