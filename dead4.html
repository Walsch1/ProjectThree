<div class="start">
  <p>The fastest way isnt always the safest way. Cutting through the city was
  not the smartest decision. There are many ways to be stealthy but there are many more
  ways to get stuck and seen as the roads were filled with zombies in every corner. As an alarm goes
  off on a car near by you and Brian are forced into a building away from the zombies.
  You find the building has zombies scattered. You run up the floors and eventially get stuck on the roof.
  Zombies at the door. You watch Brian lift up his shirt and he shows he was bitten. It was only a matter of time
  before he bit you. Instead he tries to save your life and his "soul" by falling off the roof. But you die by starvation
  three weeks later.</p>
